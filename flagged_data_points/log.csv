,"[[""What is ClearCalc？"",""ClearCalc is a radiation oncology treatment planning system's (TPS) treatment plan calculation evaluation tool. It has three components: a standalone Windows operating system executable application for administrative operations, a calculation evaluation application that uses incoming DICOM or ESAPI plan file information to perform dose and/or MU calculations, and a Monte Carlo dose calculation engine called RadMonteCarlo that uses treatment planning parameters to calculate expected doses. ClearCalc benefits users by providing accurate dose calculations and helping them ensure their treatment plans meet quality assurance standards.""]]","This is not finding the right location. Correct answer: What is ClearCalc?
ClearCalc calculation evaluation assesses the accuracy of a Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning System’s (TPS) treatment plan calculation. ClearCalc has three components:
● One is a standalone Windows Operating System executable application that is used for
administrative operations to set specified beam configuration(s), default settings, and user
settings.
● The other ClearCalc application is a calculation evaluation application that utilizes incoming
DICOM or ESAPI plan file information to perform a dose and/or monitor unit (MU) calculation on the incoming or entered treatment plan parameters.
● ClearCalc also contains a Monte Carlo dose calculation engine (RadMonteCarlo) that uses
treatment planning parameters to calculate expected doses.",,,2023-12-21 08:21:05.080389
